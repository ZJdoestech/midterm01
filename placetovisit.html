                <p class="para1"> 
                    Sarrat Church is the biggest in Ilocos Norte and possibly in the whole Ilocos region. The church is made from red bricks built in Earthquake Baroque and Neoclassical architecture. The church tower has a big clock that strikes every half-hour. Around the church are brick fourteen Stations of the Cross. The convent, also known as Casa del Palacio Real, was rebuilt after two fires in March 1816 and October 1892. It served as the Presidencia Municipal or present-day town hall. It also housed Colegio de Santa Monica, an affiliate of Lyceo de Manila. The ground floor of the convent was converted as the parish museum and photo gallery in 1994.</p>

                <p class="para2">The Padsan River, also known as the Laoag River and the Sarrat River, is the largest river in Ilocos Norte on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It has a total length of 73.1 kilometres (45.4 mi) and a drainage basin of 1,320 km2 (510 sq mi). It is notable because its main channel bisects the central townships of the municipalities of Dingras and Sarrat, as well as that of the city of Laoag, which is the capital of Ilocos Norte. As a result, its waters have shaped the history and culture of these historic towns, and of the province of Ilocos Norte. It is the site of the Madongan Dam[6] in Dingras, and is right beside Laoag International Airport in Laoag.</p>
