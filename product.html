                <h2>TUPIG</h2>
                <p>Tupig, also known as intemtem or kangkanen, is a Filipino rice cake originating from northwestern Luzon, particularly the regions of Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Ilocos. It is made from ground slightly-fermented soaked glutinous rice (galapong) mixed with coconut milk, muscovado sugar, and young coconut (buko) strips.</p>

                <h2>SAPIN SAPIN</h2>
                <p>Sapin-sapin is a layered glutinous rice and coconut dessert in Philippine cuisine. It is made from rice flour, coconut milk, sugar, water, flavoring and coloring. It is usually sprinkled with latik or toasted desiccated coconut flakes. Traditional recipe of sapin-sapin calls for different flavors mixed in each layer such as ube halaya in the purple layer, jackfruit in the yellow or orange layer, but the white layer has no flavoring. The commercial version tends to have only food coloring and no added flavoring to reduce the cost.

                <h2>BINAKOL</h2>
                <p>BINAKOL (transliterated, "to do a sphere") is a type of weaving pattern traditional in the Philippines. Patterns consisting entirely of straight lines are woven so as to create the illusion of curves and volumes. A sense of motion is also sought. Designs are geometric, but often representational. The techniques create illusionistic designs similar to op art patterns and were popular by the late 19th century, when the United States colonized the Philippines and American museums collected many traditional Philippine textiles. </p>
